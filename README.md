# UML: EDA, Model, and Prediction For Wine Quality

Welcome to the EDA, Model and Prediction of wine data. One of the ways to determine wine quality is by its physiocochemistry. The purpose of this study was to look at the physicochemical properties of the wine and analyze which model, of the ones we learned in the course, can give us the best fit, prediction and accuracy score of the quality of the wine.

## Data Source
We are using the Bank Marketing Data Set found at [https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality)

In this project, the data consisted of 6497 observations across 12 physicochemical properties and the corresponding quality. The datasets were combined combined and trained on several models.

The data was trained on each model and then predicted. After that, the accuracy test showed how well the model did at predicting the wine quality based on the physicochemical properties of the wine.

## How to use this repo
There is a Jupyter notebook which can be run to review analysis of the wine data.
